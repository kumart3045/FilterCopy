            <h2>Filter kaapi, also known as Indian filter coffee, is a traditional South Indian coffee prepared using a two-stage filtration process. Coarsely ground coffee beans, typically a blend of Arabica and Robusta varieties, are placed in a metal filter and brewed slowly with hot water, allowing the coffee to drip through over several hours. The resulting strong, concentrated decoction is then mixed with hot milk and sugar according to personal taste. Served in small steel tumblers and wide-bottomed cups, filter kaapi is known for its rich, aromatic flavor and creamy texture, making it a beloved staple in Indian households and coffee shops alike.</h2>
